# Producer and Consumer using avro schema

## Set up Kafka Environment using Docker

- This command will set up Zookeeper and the Kafka broker in your local environment.

```aidl
docker-compose up
```
## Sending request to the producer

- Once both Spring Boot services, shop-order-consumer and shop-order-service, are up and running, you can use the following JSON to make a POST request to http://localhost:8083/api/createOrder:

```
